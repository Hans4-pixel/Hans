## Building locally

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18
  - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.
- Enable Corepack by executing the command `corepack enable` within the metamask-extension project. Corepack is a utility included with Node.js by default. It manages Yarn on a per-project basis, using the version specified by the `packageManager` property in the project's package.json file. Please note that modern releases of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) are not intended to be installed globally or via npm.
- Duplicate `.metamaskrc.dist` within the root and rename it to `.metamaskrc`
  - Replace the `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` value with your own personal [Infura Project ID](https://infura.io/docs).
  - If debugging MetaMetrics, you'll need to add a value for `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` [Segment write key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/), see [Developing on MetaMask - Segment](./development/README.md#segment).
  - If debugging unhandled exceptions, you'll need to add a value for `SENTRY_DSN` [Sentry Dsn](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/), see [Developing on MetaMask - Sentry](./development/README.md#sentry).
  - Optionally, replace the `PASSWORD` value with your development wallet password to avoid entering it each time you open the app.
- Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `yarn dist`.
  - Optionally, you may run `yarn start` to run dev mode.

Uncompressed builds can be found in `/dist`, compressed builds can be found in `/builds` once they're built.

See the [build system readme](./development/build/README.md) for build system usage information.

## Git Hooks

To get quick feedback from our shared code quality fitness functions before committing the code, you can install our git hooks with Husky.

`$ yarn githooks:install`

You can read more about them in our [testing documentation](./docs/testing.md#fitness-functions-measuring-progress-in-code-quality-and-preventing-regressions-using-custom-git-hooks).

### Development builds

To start a development build (e.g. with logging and file watching) run `yarn start`.

#### React and Redux DevTools

To start the [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools), run `yarn devtools:react` with a development build installed in a browser. This will open in a separate window; no browser extension is required.

To start the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension):

- Install the package `remotedev-server` globally (e.g. `yarn global add remotedev-server`)
- Install the Redux Devtools extension.
- Open the Redux DevTools extension and check the "Use custom (local) server" checkbox in the Remote DevTools Settings, using the default server configuration (host `localhost`, port `8000`, secure connection checkbox unchecked).

Then run the command `yarn devtools:redux` with a development build installed in a browser. This will enable you to use the Redux DevTools extension to inspect MetaMask.

To create a development build and run both of these tools simultaneously, run `yarn start:dev`.

#### Test Dapp

[This test site](https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/) can be used to execute different user flows.

### Running Unit Tests and Linting

Run unit tests and the linter with `yarn test`. To run just unit tests, run `yarn test:unit`.

You can run the linter by itself with `yarn lint`, and you can automatically fix some lint problems with `yarn lint:fix`. You can also run these two commands just on your local changes to save time with `yarn lint:changed` and `yarn lint:changed:fix` respectively.

For Jest debugging guide using Node.js, see [docs/tests/jest.md](docs/tests/jest.md).

### Running E2E Tests

Our e2e test suite can be run on either Firefox or Chrome.

1. **required** `yarn build:test` to create a test build.
2. run tests, targetting the browser:

- Firefox e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:firefox`.
- Chrome e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:chrome`. The `chromedriver` package major version must match the major version of your local Chrome installation. If they don't match, update whichever is behind before running Chrome e2e tests.

These test scripts all support additional options, which might be helpful for debugging. Run the script with the flag `--help` to see all options.

#### Running a single e2e test

Single e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:single test/e2e/tests/TEST_NAME.spec.js` along with the options below.

```console
  --browser           Set the browser used; either 'chrome' or 'firefox'.
                                            [string] [choices: "chrome", "firefox"]
  --debug             Run tests in debug mode, logging each driver interaction
                                                         [boolean] [default: false]
  --retries           Set how many times the test should be retried upon failure.
                                                              [number] [default: 0]
  --leave-running     Leaves the browser running after a test fails, along with
                      anything else that the test used (ganache, the test dapp,
                      etc.)                              [boolean] [default: false]
  --update-snapshot   Update E2E test snapshots
                                             [alias: -u] [boolean] [default: false]
```

For example, to run the `account-details` tests using Chrome, with debug logging and with the browser set to remain open upon failure, you would use:
`yarn test:e2e:single test/e2e/tests/account-details.spec.js --browser=chrome --debug --leave-running`

### Changing dependencies

Whenever you change dependencies (adding, removing, or updating, either in `package.json` or `yarn.lock`), there are various files that must be kept up-to-date.

- `yarn.lock`:
  - Run `yarn` again after your changes to ensure `yarn.lock` has been properly updated.
  - Run `yarn lint:lockfile:dedupe:fix` to remove duplicate dependencies from the lockfile.
- The `allow-scripts` configuration in `package.json`
  - Run `yarn allow-scripts auto` to update the `allow-scripts` configuration automatically. This config determines whether the package's install/postinstall scripts are allowed to run. Review each new package to determine whether the install script needs to run or not, testing if necessary.
  - Unfortunately, `yarn allow-scripts auto` will behave inconsistently on different platforms. macOS and Windows users may see extraneous changes relating to optional dependencies.
- The LavaMoat policy files
  - If you are a MetaMask team member and your PR is on a repository branch, you can use the bot command `@metamaskbot update-policies` to ask the MetaMask bot to automatically update the policies for you.
  - If your PR is from a fork, you can ask a MetaMask team member to help with updating the policy files.
  - Manual update instructions: The _tl;dr_ is to run `yarn lavamoat:auto` to update these files, but there can be devils in the details:
    - There are two sets of LavaMoat policy files:
      - The production LavaMoat policy files (`lavamoat/browserify/*/policy.json`), which are re-generated using `yarn lavamoat:background:auto`. Add `--help` for usage.
        - These should be regenerated whenever the production dependencies for the background change.
      - The build system LavaMoat policy file (`lavamoat/build-system/policy.json`), which is re-generated using `yarn lavamoat:build:auto`.
        - This should be regenerated whenever the dependencies used by the build system itself change.
    - Whenever you regenerate a policy file, review the changes to determine whether the access granted to each package seems appropriate.
    - Unfortunately, `yarn lavamoat:auto` will behave inconsistently on different platforms.
      macOS and Windows users may see extraneous changes relating to optional dependencies.
    - If you keep getting policy failures even after regenerating the policy files, try regenerating the policies after a clean install by doing:
      - `rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn && yarn lavamoat:auto`
    - Keep in mind that any kind of dynamic import or dynamic use of globals may elude LavaMoat's static analysis.
      Refer to the LavaMoat documentation or ask for help if you run into any issues.
